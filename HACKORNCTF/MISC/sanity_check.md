## Challenge Description
The Hackorn's ticketing system is compromised as the organizers announced.
Update: announcement tab is hiding some secret, reveal to see through. #PlainSight
Flag sample : SPL{some_random_text}

## Solution
I'm here to join Discord to check if there are any flags. Usually, flags are sent in announcements.
