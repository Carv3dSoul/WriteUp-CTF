## Challenge Description
This file seems broken... or is it? Maybe a couple of bytes could make all the difference. Can you figure out how to bring it back to life?

## Solution

<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ae103ca-891e-4a55-b26e-93d2eed4010d" />

OK, we are given a file but it is in data form. what we don't realize is that this is a jpg image file.

Look at that, this is a jpg file but it is blocked by an anomaly code, namely \x. in hexadecimal ```5c78``` is wrong the correct one is ```ffd8```.
Here I change it only using the hexeditor tool.

we just need to change the hexadecimal. and don't forget we change the ```file``` extension from file to ```file.jpg```. If it's ready, we just open the image file
