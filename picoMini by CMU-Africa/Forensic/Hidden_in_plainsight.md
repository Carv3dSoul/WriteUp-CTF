## Challenge Description

Youâ€™re given a seemingly ordinary JPG image. Something is tucked away out of sight inside the file. Your task is to discover the hidden payload and extract the flag.

## Solution

OK, we are given an img.jpg file. In the hint, we are asked to check the metadata.

<img width="600" height="600" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-19 001927" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1917b72-89ca-42f0-8177-8cd9eb8a756a" />

I found a base64 code here, I immediately decoded the code directly.

that there is steghide:cEF6endvcmQ= when I decode it, where the contents are pAzzword.

which extracts a file called flag.txt.
